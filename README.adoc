= Ribose RPM Spec for automake116

image:https://gitlab.com/ribose/rpm-spec/rpm-spec-automake116/badges/master/pipeline.svg[Build Status (GitLab CI), link=https://gitlab.com/ribose/rpm-spec/rpm-spec-automake116/commits/master]

== Introduction

This repository hosts the RPM spec & related Docker files for building the RPM
package.


== Usage

This is an https://www.softwarecollections.org[`SCL package`] and has specific
requirements on usage.

To ensure the installation has gone well, a quick check on the version should
suffice:

```sh
scl enable ribose-automake116 -- automake --version
```

For some uses, you will also want to set or extend `ACLOCAL_PATH`.
For example, when running `autoreconf` for software that requires an m4
from a system package (such as gettext-devel), you might use:

```sh
source /opt/ribose/ribose-automake116/enable
# note that we have already sourced in the above, so we can call our (automake116) `aclocal` directly below
env ACLOCAL_PATH=$(aclocal --print-ac-dir):$(rpm --eval '%{_datadir}/aclocal') autoreconf -vfi
```

Or:

```sh
aclocal_path=$(scl enable ribose-automake116 -- aclocal --print-ac-dir):$(rpm --eval '%{_datadir}/aclocal')
scl enable ribose-automake116 -- env ACLOCAL_PATH=$aclocal_path autoreconf -vfi
```
